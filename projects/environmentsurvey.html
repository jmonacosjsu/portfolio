        <h3>1.0 Introduction</h3>
        <p>As a way to polish my Google Sheets, and survey analysis skills, I decided to dive into some Kaggle data. I have a passion for analyzing data for positive impact, and in a world where environmental challenges are becoming increasingly urgent, the role of environmental, climate, and sustanability-related education is as important as ever. I was intrigued about this particular dataset since it provided everything needed to run a statistical analysis on if environmental education has an effect on students. </p>
        <p>
          Data Source: 
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suleymansulak/environmental-attitude-dataset" 
             target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
             Environmental Attitude Dataset (Kaggle)
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This project analyzes how students’ sustainability mindsets vary across
          the demographic information provided in the survey, and exposure to environmental or
          climate-related education. 
          To summarize these responses, I came up with an Environmental Attitude
          Score (EAS). This is comparable score to represent a student's level of positive environmental awareness and sustainability attitudes. I go deeper into what this means and how it's calculated in section 2. 
         The goal of this analysis is to determine which factors available in this survey may correlate
          with stronger sustainability attitudes among students. 
        </p>

          Note: Analysis and visualizations for this project will be performed <i>entirely</i> in Google Sheets.

        <p><strong>2.1: Data Cleaning</strong></p>

          <p>The survey includes 37 total variables from demographic information as well as variables measuring
            concerns about climate change, resource use, recycling habits, and
            general environmental awareness.</p>
          <p>
            I imported the raw Kaggle dataset and reviewed its structure.When opening in Google Sheets, it came with three files: a sheet of the raw data containing each users survey input, a sheet that's an explanation for the numeric raw data, and a citation request. 
          </p>
          <p></p>
           <p>All
           fields were coded numerically, so I cleaned and transformed the data
           using <code>ARRAYFORMULA</code> to convert values into readable
           labels (e.g., Yes/No responses, sex, income category, and home
           location). Since the dataset did not include participant IDs, I
           created a unique ID column to support cleaner referencing.</p>
          <p>
            The survey contained 27 environmental attitude questions with numeric responses: 1 (absolutely disagree) - 5 (absolutely agree). Of the 27 questions, several of
            which were reverse-scored (where a value of 5 represented the least
            environmentally supportive response). To create a standardized score for all questions, I applied reverse-coding using
            <code>ARRAYFORMULA(6 - column range)</code>.

          <p><strong>2.2: Process of the EAS:</strong></p>
          <p>
            To calculate the Environmental Attitude Score (EAS), I added a
            header marker (1) above all properly formatted question
            columns. I did this to ensure the next step filters only the properly formatted questions. I then computed each participant’s EAS using a filtered
            average, and then converted it to a percentage to standardize scores:
            <code>=AVERAGE(FILTER(range of scores), (range) = 1)*2/10</code>.

            I also created a consolidated variable indicating whether each

            <code>=OR(H3="Yes", J3="Yes", L3="Yes")</code>, I generated a

    <p><strong>3.2.2: Interpretation of Additional Insights </strong></p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>
        The Environmental Attitude Score (EAS) distribution is strongly right-skewed, 
        with most students scoring between 80-100%. This suggests strong 
        environmental attitudes within this student sample.
      </li>
    
      <li>
        Average EAS differs slightly by income level and home location, but the 
        variation is small and not statistically meaningful. 
      </li>
    
      <li>
        Question 13 was if students check for a recycling symbol on products, and it had the 
        lowest average score at 63.33%. This indicates a key area where just a small behavioral 
        change like checking a label could lead to improvement in sustainability awareness.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section class="featured-section">
      <h3>4.0 Conclusion and Limitations</h3>
    
      <p>
        Overall, this 384 student dataset shows strong environmental attitudes, with an 
        average Environmental Attitude Score of 84.44%. Most students scored 
        between 80-100%, indicating a generally high level of sustainability awareness within this sample despite most students, about 70%, not having completed a environment/sustainability related course. 
        Demographic differences were minimal: income level and age showed virtually no 
        correlation with EAS, and while students living in cities scored slightly higher 
        than those in districts or towns by a couple percent, the variation was not statistically meaningful.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Additional insights highlight specific gaps in awareness. The weakest scoring 
        survey question was Question 13, whether students check for a recycling symbol when 
        buying products. This question had an average score of just 63.33%. This suggests that small, 
        everyday behaviors such as checking labels represent an opportunity for 
        improvement for many students within this sample.
      </p>
    
      <h4>4.1 Limitations</h4>
      <p>While completing this study, a few limitations were noted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some categories such as environmental course completion had small 
          “Yes” samples, due to the overall lack of relevant course completion among students,  which makes statistical significance harder to detect even when marginal 
          trends appear in the averages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Income categories in the dataset were unevenly represented, especially in the higher-income brackets. This imbalance introduces low statistical power and makes it difficult to interpret differences between income groups.
        </li>
        <li>Additionally, the income brackets are specific to the Turkish economy, which may limit broader generalizability.</li>
        <li>
          All data is self-reported, which may introduce bias, especially in questions 
          related to personal environmental practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some reverse-coded questions, including the question regarding whether students check if there's a label when recycling, introduce the possibility of misunderstanding among 
          students, potentially affecting the accuracy of some measurable variables. 
        </li>
        <li>
          More broadly, the dataset represents a single region and student population, so findings 
          may not generalize to broader national or international groups.
        </li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>
        Despite these limitations, this analysis still provides a clear picture of sustainability attitudes among students. While demographic factors and prior coursework did not have a significant influence, the consistently high EAS across the entire sample suggests that these students generally possess strong environmental awareness already. There are still opportunities for positive impact and they appear to lie in specific behaviors as seen in lower average scores within certain questions.
