        />
        <p>
          In the United States, residential electricity use varies widely across
          states and over time. Because states differ substantially in
          population size and growth, raw electricity consumption totals do not
          allow for meaningful comparison. This analysis will examine which states experienced increases or
          decreases in residential electricity consumption per capita, and
          whether those changes occurred gradually over time or were
          concentrated around specific periods. The purpose of per-capita analysis is to enable fair
          comparison across states with different population sizes and growth
          trajectories.
        </p>
        <p>
          This analysis does not claim causation. Factors such as weather,
          policy decisions, and social behavior are outside the scope of this
          project. This analaysis also does not claim specific events during the period examined had effects on electricity usage. Understanding how residential electricity consumption
          per capita has evolved over time provides context for benchmarking,
          comparative evaluation, and longer-term discussions about energy
          efficiency and economic planning.

    <h3>2.0 Sources of Data</h3>

    <h4>2.1 Electricity Sales Data</h4>
    <p>
      Residential electricity sales data were obtained from the U.S. Energy
      Information Administration (EIA). The dataset includes annual retail
      sales of electricity to ultimate consumers, disaggregated by sector
      and by state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key fields include:
      <br />• Year
      <br />• State
      <br />• Sales (MWh)
    </p>

    <h4>2.2 Population Data</h4>
    <p>
      State population data were sourced from the United States Census
      Bureau’s State Population Totals for the years 2010–2024.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key fields include:
      <br />• Year
      <br />• State
      <br />• Population
    </p>

    <p>
      These datasets were selected to allow residential electricity
      consumption to be normalized on a per-capita basis, enabling
      consistent comparisons across states and over time.

    <h3>3.0 Process: Data Cleaning, Normalization, and Validation (Python)</h3>

    <h4>3.1 Data Cleaning</h4>
    <p>
      Prior to processing in Python, both datasets were briefly reviewed in Google Sheets to verify structure,
      remove non-data headers, and confirm consistent formatting of year and state fields. The datasets were then
      imported into Python using pandas.
    </p>
    <p>The primary data-cleaning steps included:</p>
    <p>
      • <strong>Standardizing column names and data types:</strong> Column names were normalized (lowercased in the EIA file)
      and renamed to consistent fields used throughout the workflow (state, state_code, year, sales_mwh, population).<br /><br />
      • <strong>Aligning state identifiers:</strong> State names from the Census file were cleaned (leading characters removed)
      and mapped to two-letter state codes to enable a reliable join key.<br /><br />
      • <strong>Reshaping population data:</strong> Census population data were converted from wide format (years as columns)
      to long format (one row per state-year).<br /><br />
      • <strong>Filtering to comparable geography:</strong> The EIA “US” aggregate row was removed so the dataset reflects
      state-level observations only.
    </p>

    <h4>3.2 Normalization</h4>
    <p>
      After cleaning, the population and EIA sales datasets were merged on <strong>state_code</strong> and <strong>year</strong>.
      Electricity sales were converted from <strong>MWh to kWh</strong>, and per-capita consumption was computed as
      <strong>kWh per person</strong> for each state-year.
    </p>

    <h4>3.3 Validation Checks</h4>
    <p>
      Basic validation checks were used to confirm the merged dataset behaved as expected (e.g., confirming year bounds,
      expected state counts, and verifying that the merge produced the expected row count). These checks support internal
      consistency before visualization in Tableau.
    </p>
        <h4>3.4 Jupyter Notebook Processing Steps</h4>
    
        <p>
          Data processing was performed in a single Jupyter Notebook using Python
          and the pandas library. The notebook focused on reshaping the population
          data, aligning state identifiers across datasets, merging population and
          electricity sales data, and computing residential electricity consumption
          per capita.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Population data from the U.S. Census Bureau were first cleaned by
          standardizing the state column, removing non-data characters, and
          reshaping the dataset from wide format (years as columns) to long format
          (one row per state-year). State names were then mapped to two-letter state
          codes to create a consistent join key.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Residential electricity sales data from the EIA were imported separately,
          column names were standardized, and only relevant fields were retained.
          The national aggregate row was removed so that the dataset reflected
          state-level observations only.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          After cleaning, the two datasets were merged on state code and year.
          Electricity sales values were converted from megawatt-hours (MWh) to
          kilowatt-hours (kWh), and per-capita residential electricity consumption
          was calculated by dividing total electricity consumption by state
          population for each year.

    <h3>4.0 Analysis Framework</h3>
    <p>
      Tableau was used as the primary visualization tool to examine patterns in
      residential electricity consumption per capita across U.S. states. To
      allow for fair comparisons across states, electricity consumption values
      (kWh) were normalized by population rather than relying on raw electricity
      sales totals. The map below displays the percent change in residential
      electricity consumption per capita from 2010 to 2024. A few of the
      highest and lowest percent changes are labeled.
    </p>

    <h4>4.1 Percent Change in Electricity Consumption by State</h4>

      "
    />

    <p>
      The national map summarizes changes in per-capita residential electricity
      consumption between 2010 and 2024. Clear regional patterns emerge, with
      much of the Southeast exhibiting sustained declines, while several states
      in the Intermountain West show increases over the same period.
    </p>

    <h4>
      4.2 States with Increasing Per-Capita Residential Electricity Consumption
    </h4>

    <p>
      The states in this section end the study period with higher residential
      electricity consumption per capita than in the early 2010s, though the
      trajectories differ. Across these cases, consumption is relatively stable
      or declines through much of the 2010s, then rises notably after 2020. The
      increases are therefore concentrated in the early 2020s rather than
      gradual across the full period.

        />
        <p>
          Utah’s per-capita residential electricity consumption is fairly stable
          in the early 2010s, then drops noticeably between 2013 and 2014. It
          remains lower and relatively constrained through the late 2010s,
          reaching a local low around 2019. After 2020, consumption increases
          sharply and reaches the series high by 2024.

        <p>
          New Mexico shows a sustained decline from 2010 through roughly 2017.
          Consumption then rises sharply into 2020. From 2020 onward, levels
          fluctuate moderately and reach a local high around 2023.

        <p>
          Arizona’s per-capita consumption trends downward with year-to-year
          variability through 2019. Usage spikes in 2020, followed by a pullback
          in 2021. It then increases again and remains above pre-2020 levels by
          2024.

        <p>
          Maine increases through the early-to-mid 2010s before declining around
          2016. Consumption then rises again into the late 2010s and early 2020s,
          peaking around 2021. After 2021, per-capita consumption trends
          downward.

    <h4>
      4.3 States with Declining Per-Capita Residential Electricity Consumption
    </h4>

    <p>
      The states in this section exhibit a net decline in residential
      electricity consumption per capita from the early 2010s to the end of the
      period. While brief recoveries and short-term volatility appear,
      later-year levels remain below initial values. Much of the downward shift
      occurs early in the decade, followed by fluctuations around a lower
      baseline rather than a return to prior highs.

        <p>
          South Carolina drops sharply between 2010 and 2012 from an early-period
          high to a much lower level. It partially rebounds in the mid-to-late
          2010s, including noticeable increases around 2014 and 2018, but
          remains below 2010 levels. After 2019, consumption generally trends
          downward, hitting a low around 2023 before a modest rise in 2024.

        <p>
          Tennessee declines steeply in the early 2010s, especially between 2010
          and 2012. It then fluctuates through the mid-to-late 2010s with a
          local low around 2017 and a temporary uptick in 2018. Post-2019 levels
          remain below early-decade values, with additional dips around 2020 and

        <p>
          Kentucky shows a pronounced decline from 2010 to 2012. Consumption
          then oscillates across the 2010s, including a recovery around 2014 and
          a notable increase around 2018. After 2019, usage trends downward
          again, reaching a low around 2023 before a slight increase in 2024.

        <p>
          Virginia declines sharply between 2010 and 2012, then partially
          recovers to a local peak around 2014. Consumption falls again into a
          local low near 2017, followed by a temporary increase in 2018. The
          early 2020s show a gradual downward trend, reaching the series low

  <h3>5.0 Findings and Limitations</h3>

  <p>
    Tableau sheets are
    used to highlight cross-state comparisons, long-term trends, and
    differences in the timing and magnitude of changes in residential
    electricity consumption per capita. These visuals and descriptions are designed to support
    discussion on electricity usage.
  </p>

  <p>
    This analysis shows per-capita residential electricity
    consumption trends vary substantially across U.S. states, both in direction
    and timing. More specifically, much of the Southeast shows sustained declines in annual consumption per capita, while several states in the Intermountain West show increases over the same period. 
  </p>
  <p>
    While the results provide descriptive insight into how residential
    electricity consumption has evolved over time, this analysis does not
    attribute observed changes to specific causes. Factors such as weather
    variation, energy prices, housing characteristics, efficiency standards,
    and behavioral changes are outside the scope of the data used here. As a
    result, the findings should be interpreted as structural patterns rather
    than evidence of underlying drivers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Future analyses could extend this work by incorporating weather-adjusted
    demand measures, energy price data, or housing stock characteristics to
    better contextualize state-level trends. Nonetheless, the current analysis
    demonstrates how careful normalization, comparative framing, and restrained
    interpretation can yield meaningful insights while maintaining analytical
    rigor and transparency.
